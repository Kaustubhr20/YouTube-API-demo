YouTube API Demo

This is a simple demostration code that shows how powerful an API could be and how easy it is to work with APIs.
For this project purpose, I have used YouTube API provided by the Google itself. You just have to go to google developers, create your free account (or login if you already have one), register your app and get your API key.

Now, coming to the tricky part-the code- I have used react technology for the frontend development alongwith HTML and CSS. I haven't paid much attention to beautify the page because my main goal was the demonstration of API working with ReactJS. I hope you will like this repo!
